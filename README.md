# UPWAS ABM: Agent-Based Model for Water Storage Adaptation

An agent-based model (ABM) implementation for studying farmer adaptation strategies in water management systems. UPWAS (Upscaling Water Storage) integrates hydrological modeling with behavioral decision-making to simulate agricultural water storage decisions under different climate scenarios.

## Overview

The UPWAS ABM couples the [WALRUS hydrological model](walrus_abm_version.py) with farmer agents that make adaptive decisions about water storage measures (weirs and reduced channel depth) based on Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). The model simulates socio-hydrological dynamics across agricultural landscapes under various climate conditions.

### Key Features

- **Hydrological Modeling**: Integration with WALRUS for realistic water dynamics
- **Behavioral Modeling**: Agent decision-making based on Protection Motivation Theory
- **Climate Scenarios**: Support for historical and future climate projections
